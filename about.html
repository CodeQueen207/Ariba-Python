 <h1> About Me </h1>     
<p>My Name is Hafsa Bynte Noor Ariba. I am a student in IHSB, Grade 7. I am a curious and creative person who enjoys exploring new ideas and finding unique ways to express myself. I love learning about different subjects, whether it’s science, art, or technology, and I’m always eager to challenge myself with something new. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family, as well as finding little moments of peace in nature. I value kindness, imagination, and growth, and I try to bring positive energy wherever I go.</p>
